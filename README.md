# WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Project Overview

In this challenge, weather data will be added to the existing project along with the functionality of allowing users to filter the data for their own weather preferences. The preferences will be used to locate potential travel destinations and lodging. Using the Google Maps API, the program will be able to plot a travel route spanning four cities along with a map containing markers showing the city information.
